# esri_grid_helper

Scripts developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS with Python 3.10.12.

## About 

This project contains scripts which may be useful for manipulating ESRI grid files. If you find this code useful you can always support me by buying a :coffee: https://buymeacoffee.com/kowalpy :smirk:

### Create ESRI grid from CSV

Scripts create_esri_grid_from_csv.py contains example of converting CSV file into ESRI grid format. CSV expected format:

'609382, 200663, 13.6'

First 2 columns are X and Y coordinates. Third column is terrain height. It can be used to convert CSV generated by [get_terrain_heights_from_gugik](https://github.com/kowalpy/get_terrain_heights_from_gugik) or transform_baltic_csv_to_simple_csv.py

### Transform Leibniz Institute CSV to simple CSV

Script transform_baltic_csv_to_simple_csv.py can transform [digital topography of the Baltic Sea published by Leibniz Institue for Baltic Sea research Warnemunde](https://www.io-warnemuende.de/topography-of-the-baltic-sea.html) into simple CSV file which can be processed by create_esri_grid_from_csv.py

### Generate empty ESRI grid file

Scrip generate_empty_esri_grid.py is an example of creating ESRI grid file filled with zeros. This can be helpful when you combine 4 ESRI grids and you need to provide missing sea part.

### Combine 4 equal ESRI grid files

Script combine_4_equal_esri_grid_squares.py is an example of combining 4 ESRI grid squares together. 

### Reduce esri grid file by 2

Script reduce_esri_grid_by_2.py is an example of reducing resolution of ESRI grid file.

### Cut fragment of ESRI grid file

Script cut_esri_grid_fragment.py is an example of cutting desired fragment of ESRI grid.

### What can be further done with ESRI grid file?

One way of further processing is importing file into Blender using [BlenderGIS plugin](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS). 

### Example 3D models processed with project scripts
